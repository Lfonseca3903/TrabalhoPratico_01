                    <h4>Our history</h4>
                    <div class="ourstory">
                        <p>Founded in 1978, we began as a small, family-owned construction company focused on
                            residential projects in Nevada. With a passion for quality craftsmanship and a commitment to
                            customer satisfaction, we quickly built a reputation for excellence. Over the years, our
                            dedicated team grew, and so did the scope of our services, expanding into commercial and
                            industrial construction.</p>

                        <p>In the 1980s, we embraced innovative construction techniques and modern technologies,
                            allowing us to stay ahead of industry trends. This forward-thinking approach helped us
                            deliver efficient, high-quality projects. We built lasting relationships with clients,
                            earning repeat business and expanding our network across the state. Our focus on timely
                            completion and budget-conscious solutions became a hallmark of our brand.
                        </p>

                        <p>Throughout the 1990s, we continued to evolve, taking on larger, more complex projects. From
                            office buildings to retail centers, our portfolio grew, and we gained recognition for our
                            ability to handle projects of varying scales. Our experienced team of professionals ensured
                            that every detail was meticulously planned and executed, maintaining the high standards we
                            were known for.</p>

                        <p>As we entered the 2000s, we placed a greater emphasis on sustainability and eco-friendly
                            construction practices. Our commitment to reducing environmental impact became a core part
                            of our mission. We adopted green building practices and focused on energy-efficient
                            solutions for both residential and commercial properties. This shift reflected the growing
                            demand for environmentally responsible construction in Nevada.</p>

                        <p>In the 2010s, we expanded our services to include design-build and full project management
                            capabilities. This allowed us to provide clients with a more streamlined construction
                            process, from initial design to final completion. We worked with architects, engineers, and
                            subcontractors to create customized solutions that met the unique needs of each project. Our
                            reputation for exceptional service and quality continued to grow.</p>

                        <p>Today, we stand as one of Nevada’s most trusted construction companies. Our team is made up
                            of highly skilled professionals who share a commitment to excellence. We pride ourselves on
                            our ability to tackle any project, no matter the size or complexity. Our focus remains on
                            delivering high-quality results that exceed our clients' expectations.</p>

                        <p>From humble beginnings to becoming a state leader, our journey is defined by a passion for
                            quality, integrity, and innovation. We look forward to continuing our legacy of excellence
                            in construction for many years to come. As we move forward, we remain dedicated to upholding
                            the values that have defined us since 1978. With a strong foundation built on trust,
                            expertise, and innovation, we’re excited to take on new challenges and continue serving
                            Nevada’s growing construction needs.</p>
